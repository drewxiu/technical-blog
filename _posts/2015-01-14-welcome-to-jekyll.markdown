Obligatory first post for my new technical blog! I'm going to update this site weekly - biweekly with different tidbits and thoughts that I have... Usually (but not limited too!) Engineering, Science, or Economics.

Shotgun Introduction:
I previously worked at EA Sports working on the Madden Stability team and now I am doing freelance web app development. In 2016 I plan to receive a bachelor's in Computer Science and Physics from the University of Central Florida. Start ups and tech are my passion and I follow the tech scene in Silicon Valley (and China, they're coming up on the scene!) like 13 year old girls follow Gossip girl and I'm not ashamed.
